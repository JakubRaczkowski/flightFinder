Known issues :
    Code is not typescript compliant. Decided to go for solving the flow of the app and if Ill still have time to rectify ts issues.

    Add Booking/ deselect doesnt get reset in case of another search.

    Selecting one booking doesnt deselect another booking in the group that was already added, has to be done manually.

    Option to select same airports crashes the server( not much error handling done)

    Flight duration is wrong for flights which have return date on following day.
    Minimum styling
    Validation need both on back end and front end
    

    Updating booking count in db is not implemented
    Server timeout after 3 seconds is not implemented
    UI loading time is not implemented
